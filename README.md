I just joined to say thank you for disablewin 10. My pc is working better and faster now than it did when I bought it. However, I did watch the tutorial on you tube and saw that the menu was different to the one I have downloaded and was wondering how to get the block apps at the bottom of the menu . Can anyone help ???
